# What is difference between Data mart and Data lake?

#### A data mart and a data lake are both types of data storage solutions, but they have some key differences. A data mart is a small storage unit that contains filtered, structured data around a certain topic or business function. 
#### A data mart is a subset of a data lake or a data warehouse, which is another storage unit that contains only organized and structured data. 
#### A data mart can allow fast and effective analytics of relevant summarized information, while a data lake can support deeper and broader analytics and machine learning applications¹.

#### A data lake is a large storage unit that contains all types of raw, unfiltered data from an enterprise. A data lake can store data in any format, such as text, images, audio, video, etc. 
#### A data lake does not impose any schema or structure on the data, which means the data can be accessed and processed in different ways. A data lake can also be used as the basis for a data warehouse or a data mart, so that the data is then made available in structured form in the data warehouse or data mart from there⁶.

###To summarize, 
- a data lake contains all raw data that an organization has, while a data mart has filtered and well-structured data prepared for a specific function or department. A data mart is a smaller and more focused version of a data warehouse, which is a larger and more comprehensive version of a data lake. 
- A data lake can store any kind of data, while a data mart can only store structured data. A data lake can support a variety of analytics and machine learning applications, while a data mart can only support specific analyses related to its topic or function.

# What are some advantages of using a data lake?

#### Some advantages of using a data lake are:

- #### Data lakes offer rapid, flexible data ingestion and storage. Data lakes can store any format and size of data, regardless of whether it is structured, semi-structured, or unstructured. This means that data can be collected and stored without any preprocessing or transformation, which saves time and resources¹².
- #### Data lakes allow a variety of data types and data sources to be available in one location, which supports statistical discovery and analysis. Data lakes enable data scientists, analysts, and developers to access and process data in different ways, using various tools and methods. Data lakes can also support a range of analytics and machine learning applications, such as data exploration, data mining, data visualization, predictive modeling, natural language processing, and image recognition¹²³.
- #### Data lakes are scalable and cost-effective. Data lakes can handle large volumes of data and can scale up or down as needed. Data lakes also use low-cost hardware and open-source technologies, such as Hadoop, which reduce the cost of data storage and management. Data lakes can also optimize the use of resources by storing only raw data and processing it on demand, rather than storing multiple copies of processed data.
